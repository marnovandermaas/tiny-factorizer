# What is Tiny Tapeout?

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip!

Go to https://tinytapeout.com for instructions!

## How does it work?

When you edit the info.yaml to choose a different ID, the [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/gds.yaml) will fetch the digital netlist of your design from Wokwi.

After that, the action uses the open source ASIC tool called [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/) to build the files needed to fabricate an ASIC.

You can see the result of the GDS action [here](https://marnovandermaas.github.io/tt04/).
